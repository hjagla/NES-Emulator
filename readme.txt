Many years of on and off work here is the Visual Basic 2010 source code of my NES emulator. Heavily modified, bug fixed 6502 CPU code originally from bNES v1.5b2. bNES was mainly used as a reference after this to build the emulator ground up.

This is no where near from a perfect emulator. It will only play a few NES ROMS without crashing and PPU emulation is enough to make some games work. No sound emulation.

Feel free to modify the code, make improvements, fix bugs, clean up the code. All I ask is that if you share it, give credit where credit is due and share the source code.
